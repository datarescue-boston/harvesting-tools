# Wget Loop

## Usage
```sh
./download.sh 
```
## Setup
This wickedly simple script has three parts:

### 1. paths.txt
This file is a list of urls to download, one url per line. Use url.txt to add the domain to relative urls. Consider generating this list with the [jquery URL extraction](../jquery-url-etraction) or any other suitable automated method. 

### 2. url.txt
**If you're using absolute urls make sure the url.txt file is blank.**

Whatever's in this file gets added to each entry in paths.txt, so if url.txt is:

	http://www.reddit.com

and the first line of paths.txt is
	
	/r/dataisbeautiful

the wget will look for

	http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful

### 3. download.sh
run this script by navigating a terminal to the wget-loop directory and entering:

	./download.sh

This will start the download process. All files will be downloaded to the /data directory in this folder.

## Pauses between downloads.
This script puts a short "break" between each download, this is so that we're nice to the servers we're downloading from. Please leave this sleep in to avoid hurting anyone's servers.
