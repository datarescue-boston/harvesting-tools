## watir.rb

This script uses Ruby's [watir](https://watir.com/) library to scrape URL's from inside a brosewr environment. Like the [Jquery URL Extraction tool](../jquery-url-extraction), it allows capture of URL's that are not visible without a running browser. 

## Usage
This tool was designed as a single use _ad hoc_ script for a particular database.  Use it as example code to write similar tools for other collections. 

## Issues
Does not define a set of obviously-visible variables/regexps that would allow rapid redeployment to another case; does notmfeet the specifications outlined in this repo's [README](./README.md).
